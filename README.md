# CLI-game

A command line interface game I made. This game is inspired by Fireship's youtube video (https://youtu.be/_oHByo8tiEY)
I made some changes to the game shown in the video. Particularly I changed the questions, the final and initial messages, and some of the text colors and gradients
Since I made this on Independence Day, I thought I'll make it an independence day related quiz.

I also published this game as an npm package.
You can try to play this game yourself by just running this one command on your command line:
```
npx kaushik-cli-tool
```
